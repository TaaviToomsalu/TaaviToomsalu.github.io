This is a site I built following along a tutorial in studioweb.com. Its goal is to show what technologies I have learned in web development to potential employers.

Right now I am contemplating to making it look more modern. Another choice would be to build a wordpress site that would look modern and keep that
one here as sort of a memory. 

I had a worpress site at 000webhost.com, but since it was a free built site it was taken down due to too many traffic.
